# Olimp-Project
Hello everybody!
This is a test project that was performed for All-Ukrainian Student Olympiad on software development by a team of school students under my leadership. The idea was to develop a game portal that would show higher education institutions and showed what needs to be done in order to get into them. You can use it on this [link](http://www.olimp.knu.ua/)
